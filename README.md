## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± I hold a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics, where my research was focused on validating new radiation therapy techniques, specifically JO-IMRT, using Monte Carlo simulation and measurement, with an emphasis on translating this technique into clinical practice (Duong et al. Physica Medica 2017; Duong et al. Reports of Practical Oncology and Radiotherapy 2019). Notably, my doctoral research contributed to improved treatment approaches for numerous head and neck cancer patients.

ðŸ‘¯I have over 11 years of extensive cross-functional experience, working as a clinical medical physicist at Dong Nai General Hospital. My roles included but were not limited to performing daily, weekly, and monthly quality assurance on Siemens LINAC and CT scanners, conducting CT simulation, planning for Brachytherapy and External Beam Radiation Therapy including 3D-CRT, IMRT, and VMAT, patient-specific QA for using an Ion Chamber, MapCheck2, and Octavius 4D, operating a LINAC to deliver treatment plans, oversight of special treatment procedures. In addition, I have been well trained on medical physics by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP, Italy), Hokkaido University (Japan), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (Malaysia), and the prominent Hospital in Vietnam. 

ðŸ”­ Beyond working at Dong Nai General Hospital, I have been actively involved in installing the first Halcyon in Vietnam and starting a new radiation therapy department at Shingmark Hospital since 2019. Subsequently, I became more familiar and experienced with the system selection, installation, and commissioning a Halcyon LINAC. I consequently acquired a great deal of expertise in nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, and medical imaging. Until now, I still keep supporting them by introducing my medical physics students to work there as well as researching and consulting them to develop the department (Duong et al. Frontiers in Oncology 2023).

ðŸ˜„ In 2020, I shifted my career focus to academia by joining HCMC University of Technology and Education, driven by a passion for research and teaching. Here I took on the duties of overseeing Criterion 5 in the AUN-QA evaluation (ASEAN institution Network-Quality Assurance) and creating the curriculum for biomedical imaging technology at the institution. My teaching responsibilities included courses in biomedical imaging technology and image processing. Additionally, I have supervised undergraduate students for their theses, guiding them in their academic and research pursuits.

âš¡Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Associate at Western University, Canada. My project is personalized dosimetry in targeted radionuclide therapy, focusing on predicting absorbed doses in prostate cancer treated by 177Lu-PSMA, using the Monte Carlo simulation. My long-term goal is to become a qualified medical physicist and toward an ABR certification to work as a researcher and to work in the clinic.
